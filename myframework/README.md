# myframework

This is a collection of libraries I created for writing my early programs as a kid.

Includes:
- objsdl: object-oriented wrapper around SDL2, SDL2_ttf and SDL2_image
- gui: extension of objsdl, containing some UI elements such as dialogs
- utils: other libraries I needed at some point
